## üßê Abstract <a name = "abstract"></a>
The purpose of  Book Shop Inventry System is to automate the existing manual system by 
the help of computerized equipments and full-fledged computer software, fulfill their 
requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period 
with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. 

The required software and hardware 
are easily available and easy to work with.
 Book Shop Inventry System, as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable and
fast management system. 

It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities 
rather to concentrate on the record keeping. Thus it will help organization in better 
utilization of resources. The organization can maintain computerized records without 
redundant entries. That means that one need not be distracted by information that is not 
relevant, while being able to reach the information.


The aim is to automate its existing manual system by the help of computerized 
equipments and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that 
their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and
manipulation the same. Basically, the project describes how to manage for good 
performance and better services for the clients. 


## Introduction <a name = "introduction"></a>
The " Book Shop Inventry System" has been developed to override the problems prevailing
in the practicing manual system. This software is supported to eliminate and in some 
cases reduce the hardships faced by this existing system. Moreover this system is 
designed for the particular need of the company to carry out operations in a smooth and 
effective manner.


The application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the data. It 
also provides error message while entering invalid data. No formal knowledge is needed 
for the user to use this system. Thus by this all it proves it is user-friendly. Electricity 
Billing System, as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast 
management system. It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather 
to concentrate on the record keeping. Thus it will help organization in better utilization 
of resources




## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you to develop the  Book Shop Inventry System project in java using (GUI) Graphical User Interface, Java Swing and Java awt. 

[Steps to Develop a EBS usng Java GUI](#steps_to_develop_a_ebs_using_java_gui) 

1.Eclipse IDE Installation

2.XAMPP app Installation

3.Create a Project File in Eclipse

4.Drag and Drop GUI'S

5.Button Configuration

### Eclipse IDE Installation
Eclipse IDE is a Free open-Source, Cross-plate form Integrated Development 
Environment (IDE) with built-in support for the JAVA Programming Language. It can 
run any machine which consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It consists of many 
features for application development as follows:

‚Ä¢Drag & Drop Graphical User Interface (GUI) Creation.

‚Ä¢Excellent editing (advanced source code editor)

‚Ä¢Web-service

‚Ä¢Excellent debugging

‚Ä¢Wizards, code generation and management tools, and many more.

Step 1: You need to have a setup file of the Eclipse IDE JAVA into your setup.

Step 2: If you didn‚Äôt have the setup you can download from the following link:

```
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/2022-12/R/eclipse-inst-jre-win64.exe&mirror_id=1248

   5. Now when we run the file in Eclipse Id as mysql connection cod given in this file . it auto connected 
       with mysql data and run on apache server.

### Create a Project File in beans
Launch the Eclipse IDE

```

3. In the Name and Location page of the wizard, do the following

4. Click Finish

### DRAG and DROP GUI'S

In the Projects window, right-click the DragAndDropSample project, 

choose New > ![UI](https://github.com/Pardeep2842/BookShop-Project/assets/127415810/358919c6-cde4-43ce-8ab3-6e4e5bd0c484)
